This folder contains files that were used in preparing and testing the package
grouper. This file contains a brief description of files that may be useful
to the user:

* `example_datasets_descriptions.qmd`
* `application_dsa3101.qmd` (pref-based model, with sub-groups)
* `applictaion_hs2914.qmd` (diversity-based model)

The above files contain demonstrations on how to use `grouper` with the anonymised
student datasets from the data science course and the interdisciplinary course.

* `paper.md`
* `paper.bib`
* `pba_example_ds.png`
* `dba_example_hs.png`

The above files are used in the paper submission.

* `code_*.R`
* `testing*.R`

The above files contain preliminary versions of the functions in the package.

* `prepare_hs2914_data.qmd`
* `prepare_dsa3101.qmd`

General users will not be able to run the code in the above quarto documents,
since they require the raw data from the courses. As it includes identifiable
information, we are unable to include it in the repository.
