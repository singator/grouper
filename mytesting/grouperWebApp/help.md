## About this app

This app was developed to help educators split students into groups. There are 
two approaches:

1. To maximise the diversity within groups (DBA)
2. To maximise the preference that students have, for certain topics. (PBA)

Students do not already have to be in precise groups. For instance, for the PBA
approach, you could send out a survey for them to fill in, where they indicate
who they wish to work with, and their ranking of the topics you have listed.

If a student is on his/her own, that's ok too. The student will be matched with
other incomplete groups.

For more information about the optimisation model, please check out the vignettes 
on the [following page](https://cran.r-project.org/package=grouper). Feel free 
to [email me](mailto:vik.gopal@nus.edu.sg) if you would like to discuss in person.
