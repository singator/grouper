## TODO list

1. Corner cases for extract_student_info:
   - no demographics
   - no skills
   - no self-formed groups
2. Validate w1 and w2
3. Allow for other pairwise dissimilarity metrics
4. Two main models:
   - with demographics and skills, but no preferences (model 1)
   - with sub-groups +  topic preferences but not demographics and/or skills (model 2)
