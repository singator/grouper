## Interview

To better understand the real-world demands, requirements, and/or pain points of
group allocation in academic settings, in-depth interviews with two faculty
members from from contrasting disciplines were conducted. The insights obtained
provided a good understanding of the relevant considerations when performing group
assignments.

The first professor interviewed was from the School of Computing at National
University of Singapore. In his course, the professor uses a two-stage group
formation process. In the first stage, students form sub-groups, on their
own, of up to three members. Allowing students to form groups on their own helps to 
minimize communication friction since there would be a certain level of familiarity 
between members. 

These sub-groups are then matched, to create larger project teams of six.
Matching is carried out with the objective of neutralizing differences in skill
levels across the final teams. In order to do so, a survey is used to capture
information about each studentâ€™s major and his/her self-rated understanding of
relevant concepts and tools.

In a separate course in our own department (Department of Statistics and Data
Science), we also follow this process of sub-groups. In our case, each final
group is made up of 8 members - four from sub-group 1 and four from sub-group 2.
Each sub-group has different duties related to a single topic. For instance,
sub-group 1 usually builds a user-interface for the software, while sub-group 2
carries out the data analysis/modeling. However, in our case, we prioritise the
preference of each self-formed group for their roles and topics. Students are
allowed to form self-formed groups of size up to 4. This ensures familiarity
within sub-groups, but, by matching sub-groups randomly, students are possibly 
forced to collaborate with a group they may not know so well. This replicates what
happens at the workplace.

In the second interview, we approached a faculty member from the Department of
Communications and New Media to gain a better understanding of the practical
challenges in group allocation for courses in the Arts and Social Sciences
field. The professor indicated that, for certain topics/tasks, the main
objective in group allocation is to achieve diversity. According to her, the
ideal group should encompass a range of viewpoints and expertise, drawn from
varied academic specializations and personal backgrounds, e.g. year of study.
She explained that when group members come from the same background, there is a
risk that the team will lack the multi-faceted perspectives necessary to
generate an appropriate solution. A diverse group is more likely to develop a
broader range of innovative solutions.

In summary, from our interviews and our literature review, we observe there are
several factors that are important when performing group assignment in higher
education. These range from student preferences to faculty time to diversity
within groups. Random assignment is far from ideal. Our package provides a
starting point to handle some of the cases discussed above in a flexible manner.
